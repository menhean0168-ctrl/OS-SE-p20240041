## Answers to Lab Questions

1. **What is the difference between `userdel` and `userdel -r`?**
   > userdel removes only the user account. userdel -r also deletes the user's home directory and mail spool.

2. **Why is it safer to use `visudo` instead of directly editing `/etc/sudoers`?**
   > visudo validates the syntax before saving. A syntax error in /etc/sudoers can lock all users out of sudo, so direct editing is risky.
3. **What happens when a `setgid` directory contains files created by different users? What benefit does this provide for team collaboration?**
   > New files automatically inherit the directory's group instead of the creator's primary group. This ensures all team members can access each other's files without manual chown.

4. **What limitation of standard Unix permissions does the ACL system solve?**
   > Standard Unix permissions only allow one owner and one group per file. ACLs allow fine-grained access for multiple specific users or groups without changing the file's primary ownership.
